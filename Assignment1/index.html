    <!-- For each question I have created four sections in HTML code. -->
    <!-- The first section is the class "questionnumber" that just selects the question number for styling -->
    <!-- The second is a <div> that has the class "qna" which contains both the question and answer -->
    <!-- The third is a <div> that has the class "answers" which is just for the answer itself -->
    <!-- The fourth is a class named "questions" that isolates the questions themselves -->

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 1.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience
        was the opening animation that plays when the page is initially loading.
        The art style was very reminiscent of comic-book style dot printing.
        Upon completion of the page loading, the first thing I noticed was the
        main tag-line, “The man whose work we don’t notice”. Having a large
        title or tagline at the top of your page helps the viewer understand
        immediately what your webpage is about. You want the biggest element to
        be the first one seen.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 2.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        <ol>
          <li>
            I read the top navigation bar options, ‘PROFESSION, PAINTINGS, WHAT
            HAPPENS IF, WHAT CAN BE DONE’ and decided to start by scrolling down
            the page to read more.
          </li>
          <li>
            I scrolled down the page to see a few animations such as the janitor
            character moving from left to right, the broom in his hand swinging,
            and the images of trash disappearing as they moved through them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I then noticed that the background of the page wasn’t a solid colour
            background but actually an image of what looked like to be
            dark-coloured tissues or paper to suit the theme of the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            I noticed the drawing animation around the word, ‘BUT’ to symbolise
            the urgency around that word in the sentence
          </li>
          <li>
            I read the next paragraph and looked at the supporting imagery given
          </li>
          <li>
            After scrolling down more, I had paid more attention to the visual
            theme of the website. I noticed the images and text boxes were
            bordered with torn paper and that most of the background images are
            very reminiscent of paper cut-outs and cut comic book art as if they
            were scrap pieces of paper, as trash.
          </li>
          <li>
            I scrolled down to the, ‘BUT THAT’S CHANGED NOW’ section and saw the
            animation of the paper slips falling off of the flyers.
          </li>
          <li>
            I noticed the page sometimes would not always continue scrolling.
            Sometimes the page would stop scrolling down but instead would play
            animations that change as you scroll either up or down.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 3.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        I spent most of the time interacting with the various animations on the
        page. I found myself very fascinated with how the creator was able to
        have the page pause in certain sections to play an animation rather than
        continue scrolling. While interacting with those particular sections, I
        found myself wondering how this was achieved and I estimated that the
        page actually was scrolling with a static background and the images were
        following the centre of your screen as you scroll.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 4.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The most common action while I was interacting with this website was
        scrolling. Apart from clicking on the navigation buttons at the top of
        the page, the only other interactable element was the scrolling of the
        page. Scrolling was the only action that allowed the page to progress
        its story and message.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 5.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        My impression of the intended primary goal was to create awareness
        around the disrespect and ignorance we give to janitorial figures and
        other people in working professions in today’s society. The text
        highlighted how janitors were once highly regarded in the past and how
        we should treat them better today.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 6.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        This goal is communicated by both informative and historical text
        combined with simple 2D animations. The text was written for more
        in-depth explanations about janitors and their history, whereas the
        animations were included as supportive imagery and to potentially cater
        for younger audiences observing this webpage too.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 7.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        I think this experience only needs to be used once for about 2-4 minutes
        to understand the primary message. It took me 2 minutes and 40 seconds
        to scroll down to the bottom of the page reading each piece of text
        rather quickly and going through each animation once quickly. If someone
        were using this for the first time, I would estimate it would take them
        a little longer to take in every piece of information. As the experience
        is the same each time, there would not be a use case for trying it a
        second time.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 8.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The interaction conveys how it should be interacted with by having
        animations that change as you scroll and having more information that
        appears as you scroll. It makes it obvious what to do by giving more as
        you repeat the same action.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 9.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The experience references newspaper articles, film photography, and
        paintings through its supportive imagery and history about the janitor.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 10.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The references to physical forms of media indicate that you should
        interact with the webpage in a physical manner of scrolling. Although
        there are navigation buttons at the top of the page, I estimate these
        are for accessibility’s sake. In physical forms of media such as a
        newspaper your eyes read down each article, similar to the act of
        scrolling on a webpage.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 11.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The references to physical forms of media communicate you should feel
        that there is a rich history to janitors and working professionals and
        that it is ignorant of us to insult them.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 12.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The most frustrating part of the interaction is when you are observing
        the animations, they never appear perfectly smooth as they rely on your
        scrolling speed to move. Each animation usually plays in about 3 quick
        scrolls which doesn’t look pleasing.
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 13.</h3>
    <div class="qna">
      <p class="questions">
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </p>
      <div class="answers">
        The most satisfying part of the interaction is seeing the short marker
        animations around words appear. They draw attention to what they’re
        outlining and always appear smooth, no matter the scrolling speed.
