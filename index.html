    <h2>Interactive Experience Research Project</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 1.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </p>
    The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience was
    the opening animation that plays when the page is initially loading. The art
    style was very reminiscent of comic-book style dot printing. Upon completion
    of the page loading, the first thing I noticed was the main tag-line, “The
    man whose work we don’t notice”. Having a large title or tagline at the top
    of your page helps the viewer understand immediately what your webpage is
    about. You want the biggest element to be the first one seen.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 2.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I read the top navigation bar options, ‘PROFESSION, PAINTINGS, WHAT
        HAPPENS IF, WHAT CAN BE DONE’ and decided to start by scrolling down the
        page to read more.
      </li>
      <li>
        I scrolled down the page to see a few animations such as the janitor
        character moving from left to right, the broom in his hand swinging, and
        the images of trash disappearing as they moved through them.
      </li>
      <li>
        I then noticed that the background of the page wasn’t a solid colour
        background but actually an image of what looked like to be dark-coloured
        tissues or paper to suit the theme of the webpage.
      </li>
      <li>
        I noticed the drawing animation around the word, ‘BUT’ to symbolise the
        urgency around that word in the sentence
      </li>
      <li>
        I read the next paragraph and looked at the supporting imagery given
      </li>
      <li>
        After scrolling down more, I had paid more attention to the visual theme
        of the website. I noticed the images and text boxes were bordered with
        torn paper and that most of the background images are very reminiscent
        of paper cut-outs and cut comic book art as if they were scrap pieces of
        paper, as trash.
      </li>
      <li>
        I scrolled down to the, ‘BUT THAT’S CHANGED NOW’ section and saw the
        animation of the paper slips falling off of the flyers.
      </li>
      <li>
        I noticed the page sometimes would not always continue scrolling.
        Sometimes the page would stop scrolling down but instead would play
        animations that change as you scroll either up or down.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 3.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>
    I spent most of the time interacting with the various animations on the
    page. I found myself very fascinated with how the creator was able to have
    the page pause in certain sections to play an animation rather than continue
    scrolling. While interacting with those particular sections, I found myself
    wondering how this was achieved and I estimated that the page actually was
    scrolling with a static background and the images were following the centre
    of your screen as you scroll.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 4.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </p>
    The most common action while I was interacting with this website was
    scrolling. Apart from clicking on the navigation buttons at the top of the
    page, the only other interactable element was the scrolling of the page.
    Scrolling was the only action that allowed the page to progress its story
    and message.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 5.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </p>
    My impression of the intended primary goal was to create awareness around
    the disrespect and ignorance we give to janitorial figures and other people
    in working professions in today’s society. The text highlighted how janitors
    were once highly regarded in the past and how we should treat them better
    today.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 6.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>
    This goal is communicated by both informative and historical text combined
    with simple 2D animations. The text was written for more in-depth
    explanations about janitors and their history, whereas the animations were
    included as supportive imagery and to potentially cater for younger
    audiences observing this webpage too.

    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 7.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </p>
    I think this experience only needs to be used once for about 2-4 minutes to
    understand the primary message. It took me 2 minutes and 40 seconds to
    scroll down to the bottom of the page reading each piece of text rather
    quickly and going through each animation once quickly. If someone were using
    this for the first time, I would estimate it would take them a little longer
    to take in every piece of information. As the experience is the same each
    time, there would not be a use case for trying it a second time.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 8.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </p>
    The interaction conveys how it should be interacted with by having
    animations that change as you scroll and having more information that
    appears as you scroll. It makes it obvious what to do by giving more as you
    repeat the same action.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 9.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </p>
    The experience references newspaper articles, film photography, and
    paintings through its supportive imagery and history about the janitor.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 10.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    The references to physical forms of media indicate that you should interact
    with the webpage in a physical manner of scrolling. Although there are
    navigation buttons at the top of the page, I estimate these are for
    accessibility’s sake. In physical forms of media such as a newspaper your
    eyes read down each article, similar to the act of scrolling on a webpage.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 11.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    The references to physical forms of media communicate you should feel that
    there is a rich history to janitors and working professionals and that it is
    ignorant of us to insult them.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 12.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </p>
    The most frustrating part of the interaction is when you are observing the
    animations, they never appear perfectly smooth as they rely on your
    scrolling speed to move. Each animation usually plays in about 3 quick
    scrolls which doesn’t look pleasing.
    <h3 class="questionnumber">Question 13.</h3>
    <p class="questions">
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </p>
    The most satisfying part of the interaction is seeing the short marker
    animations around words appear. They draw attention to what they’re
    outlining and always appear smooth, no matter the scrolling speed.
